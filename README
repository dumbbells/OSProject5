Mark,

To compile type make

To run type ./oss

To get the verbose option, type -v after ./oss

There have been some unexpected shared memory detachment errors. I'm not sure if this bug is persistent in the current build.

Sometimes the deadlock count is a little low. Sometimes it is as many as 20.

My policy for the dead locks is to kill the process in the deadlock with the most resources being waited on.

Greg
